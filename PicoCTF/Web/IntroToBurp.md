Difficulty: easy
In this challenge you register an account and it will automatically redirects you to a dashboard where you have to put a code for 2factor-authentication.But the problem is you don't know the code nor do do you know the length of the code hence brute forcing the parameter is no go.
So the the best way is to intercept the traffic in burp for the 2factor,then clear the parameter and you will get your flag.
