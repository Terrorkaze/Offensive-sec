I loved this one i tried it without less arguments to see if it will narrow it down,i did make some mistakes keeping up with many arguments is tiring. But i used find again for this challenge .
since am scanning through the top level directory (/) i used 2< /dev/null for error handling
find / -type f  -user bandit7 -group bandit6 size 33c 2</dev/null
